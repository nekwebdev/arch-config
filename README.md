# arch-config

WIP do not run it :)

This project is an ansible playbook to configure a vanilla arch linux for my personal use. Inspired (read copied) by <https://github.com/pigmonkey/spark>

Did not make a fork as I am doing a lot of pick and choose :) Don't judge the commit history either!

Make sure to edit `group_vars/all` to fit your needs.
